#Todo list using React + vite
My Awesome TodoList App

This project was created as a hands-on learning experience to solidify my understanding of fundamental React concepts. Throughout its development, I gained practical knowledge in several key areas, including:

React Hooks:I extensively utilized various built-in hooks like `useState` for managing dynamic data, `useEffect` for handling side effects (such as local storage interaction), and potentially others like `useRef` or custom hooks to enhance component logic and reusability.
Component State Management: This project provided a practical context for understanding how to manage component-specific data using `useState`, how state updates trigger re-renders, and how to pass data down through props.
React Fundamentals: Beyond hooks and state, I reinforced my understanding of core React principles such as component creation (both functional and class-based, though the focus here is on hooks), JSX syntax for rendering UI, event handling, and the overall component lifecycle (especially with `useEffect`).
